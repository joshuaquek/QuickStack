Production-grade NodeJS web application template built with:

* React (Frontend Framework)
* Semantic UI (Design Library)

* React-Easy-State (Frontend Reactive State)
* Express (Backend Framework)
* LokiJs (Server Cache)
* PassportJs (Authentication)
* Mongoose (MongoDB)

...which also uses:

* Bluebird (More efficient than native Promise library)
* FlowType (Better code governance during development)

## Contributing

In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code.
